# UT_lin_comparison
A matlab code of the Example 14.1 of "Optimal state estimation" from Dan Simon (p.434)

We have recreated the "polar to cartesian" transformation of the Example from the book.
The results shows the linearized and nonlinear UT mean and covariance of 10000 randomly generated points with a radius normaly distributed between ±0.01
and an orientation normaly distributed between ±0.35 rad.
