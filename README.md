# UT_lin_comparison
A matlab code of the Example 14.1 of "Optimal state estimation" from Dan Simon (p.434)

I have implemented the "polar to cartesian" transformation example from the book.
The results show the linear and nonlinear UT mean and covariance of 10000 sample points randomly generated (with a gaussian) with a radius between ±0.01
and an orientation between ±0.35 rad.
